                Make sure you're
                getting quality
                sushi-grade Ahi Tunaâ€”it tastes MUCH better raw than your average grocery store cut of tuna. Remember:
                frozen sushi-grade
                fish doesn't mean its not fresh. In fact, in many cases that fish was frozen at the height of freshness
                and will make
                for a delicious and flavorful piece of seared tuna. Consulting your local fish monger is the best way to
                get a great
                piece of fish, so don't be shy. ðŸ˜Š</p><br><br>
